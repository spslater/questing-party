# Kid's Character Sheet
## Abilities

| Health | Power | Sense |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |

I am torn on if these should be d20s or their level dice but I am leaning towards dice level. May
just default to like 10 and then only have modifiers apply to it? That's not how real people work
though and that'd be equivalent to just having no special ability and just using what feats you have
for whatever challenge. Maybe start with max d4 and then roll each level up for adding that new
amount? That would wildly swing though.

If have a base point buy then you'd be able to pick what level you want those to be at. Everything
could be feats actually, and just start at like level 1 for those and then specific skills give you
`+X` in those areas (or a `-X` if you want to do worse).

I had wanted to do a `Luck` ability but can't think of anything right now, so I'm not gonna expand
on it right now but will keep ruminating on it.

In Austin Walker's [Realis](https://thecalcutec.itch.io/realis) game, the Sentences (powers /
skills) get stronger the more specific they get and I think that is really cool. I'm picturing a
similar thing here where

### Health
A mix of how sturdy the character is and how good it is at taking damage. A healthy person can take
a fall from a tree relatively well (thru a mix of knowing how to roll, having stronger muscles, ect)
while someone who doesn't have that experience would get more injured.

### Power
A combination of Strength, Dexterity, and Speed, a "how good is your body at moving" stat.
Specialization will happen based on what feats the kid takes. They'll be able to have feats that
give them bonuses or advantages in spots where they need to move heavy things or have another
feat that lets them balance across a narrow ledge easier. 

### Sense
A combination of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Basically a "how good your brain is" stat.
Similar to **Power** different feats will allow the kid to specialize into being good at technology
or convincing the squad to continue exploring.

## Skills / Feats
The primary way that leveling will happen is thru skills / feats (I haven't settled on terminology
yet). XP would be gathered thru completing missions into the dungeon. These can be purely
exploratory or trying to clear out a room of pests or picking up loot. Different feats will cost
different amounts. Instead of a big list of feats you can pick anything from there will be a tech
tree / web that'll help guide choices. Thinking of something a bit more complex than the
[Star Wars FFG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Roleplaying_Game_(Fantasy_Flight_Games))
talent trees but much less complex than the
[Path of Exile skill tree](https://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree). I think it'll be
pseudo-classless in that anyone can pick whatever feats they want and go down whatever path they
want, but will have "classes" that help guide useful picks. Equipment will have requirements based
on certain feats or like skill checks to pass.

### Classes
GURPS doesn't have classes and just has you pick skills that you want with various prereqs. I like
this idea but know that having a big list gets intimidating and it's hard to pick from a big list
with little to no guidance. I generally feel pretty constrained in D&D and Pathfinder with trying
to build the exact archetype for the character I want to play. I'm picturing having the classes be
more guidelines that'll help you work towards a goal than anything else. Classes may even just be
for small ideas like "good at bows" or "good leader" than big concepts like "druid" or "fighter".
Probably have a some paths that also point to other paths like "brawler" that would have "wrestling"
and "tank" subpaths while that "tank" subpath may also appear for a "guard" path.
